## Description: 
Welcome to my website's github repository. My blog is built and hosted using jekyll's integrated github hosting service and uses a combination of markdown, html and javascript to compile and serve static webpages. My blog posts typically make use of three js for visualization of certain topics, and all this code lives in the aptly named `code` directory. Please feel free to poke around, and let me know if you have any questions, comments or issues!


## Repository Directory Structure:

`_drafts`: In-progress blog posts live here (this is a privileged directory in jekyll's framework).
`_includes`: This is another priviledged directory that contains markdown and html pages that can be included in posts.
`_notes`: This is just a place for me to store my notes.
`_posts`: This is where all my blog posts live.
`_site`: This is the webroot directory used by jekyll to serve pages to client browsers. It is automatically built by jekyll.
`code`: This is where all my code snippets, classes, and external library dependencies live.
